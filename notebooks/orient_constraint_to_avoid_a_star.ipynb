    "# Concept\n",
    "After initially making this way too complicated, this is how I ultimately approached this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the line between the target and contaminant as a stick that can be moved and rotated. Think of the aperture as a rectangular box. You are free to move the stick and rotate this stick in order to fit it in the box. This is effectively the same as moving and rotating the aperture, but I find it easier to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find it helpful to consider trying to fit sticks of decreasing length. First, if the stick is longer than the diagonal, it cannot fit in the box at any angle. If it is shorter than this, it can always fit along the diagonal, so this is a good place to start. Now, if the stick is a little longer than the long dimension of the box, I could begin twisting it so that it is more aligned with the box's length and eventually the stick will contact the ends of the box. At this point I could slide the stick left and right so that one end is in a corner, but that wouldn't allow me to twist the stick any further. The same is true if I were to twist the stick, starting from the diagonal, in the other direction. So I might as well keep it centered and use that to determine my angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since I cannot increase the angles in which the stick fits by moving it, I can just consider keeping it centered. In this case, twisting the stick would cause the ends to draw out a circle with a radius equal to half the length of the stick and the contacts would be where this circle intersects the edges of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "(I just realized I could generalize this to any shape by starting with the stick aligned with the greatest distance between to vertices... kinda satisfying, but I won't go down that path.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I could keep shortening the stick, but the result will be the same -- I'can get it any more tilted by sliding it around, even if it is shorter than the long dimension so that it only contacts the long sides of the box. And of course if I kept shortening it, eventually it will fit at any angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if one end of the stick is not allowed to move beyond a certain distance from center? This is equivalent to imposing a certain accuracy on target centering in the aperture. In this case, it is still best to start with the stick aligned to a diagonal, with the stick as close to centered as possible so that the \"target end\" is at the maximum radius away from the center as allowable. Then I will fit the most angles by rotating the stick about the center of the box. Moving it any further off center would either violate the accuracy criterion in one direction or just cause the stick to contact a side earlier in the other direction. In this case, the problem is reduced to asking where a circle with a radius equal l/2 + (l/2 - r) = l - r, where l is the length of the stick and r is the accuracy criterion, contacts the sides of the box. QED."
